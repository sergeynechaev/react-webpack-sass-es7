# Basic template for ReactJS development
> react + webpack + sass + babel (ES7)

	This is my own starter template for react.js development:

* react 0.14
* react-router 1.0
* webpack + hot-loader
* sass
* babel transpiler to support ES7 features

## Usage

Clone this repo into your local:
```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sergeynechaev/react-webpack-sass-es7.git <your-project-name>
```

Then, run:
```shell
npm install
bower install
```

## Development

Modify the files under `/src` directory.


## Production

Output is in the folder `/build`
